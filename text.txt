Coexistence:
The Future is Unlicensed: Coexistence in the Unlicensed Spectrum for 5G
1. 5G flexible requirement: ultra dense, scalable, customizable (IoT)
2. flexible UL/DL allocation; finite BW; scalable transmission time interval; op at diff bands
3. 5G needs to use unlicensed bands for its own app; however, there are many other app o this band (existing networks) & lack of coordination
including heterogeneity, mass connectivity, ubiquitous IoT devices
4. so 5G needs mechanism to coexist in unlicensed bands -> Wifi is a likely
5. deploy network resource by traffic forecast and failure scenario
6. need sparse capacity since have sudden increase while; but not as more as possible -> a waste -> need a dynamic mechanism to adapt this
7. micro-cell over-provisioned; small-cell even further (too many heterogeneous) -> so traffic variation
8. why use unlicensed spectrum in 5G spec? -> provide flexibility and agility for expanding capacity using; cost aspect -> unlicensed bands are free
to use (new unlicensed bands: 7/11 GHz in mm waveband)
9. unlicensed bands also for massive IoT devices, so high heterogeneous, variable load requirement; massive connectivity (allow for access to
spectrum for innovation)
10. cognitive radio/dynamic spectrum access need to provide reliable coex mechanism not to hazard other app in light-licensed/unlicensed Spectrum
11. so why coexistence matters in 5G? -> high heterogeneity, diff app require diff performance measurement (transmission power)
12. challenges in coexistence problem? -> heterogeneous devices use diff protocols -> no coordinate with each other (LTE-U no listen-before-talk, but
Wifi has; LTE-U adapts its offline period when Wifi online)
13. LTE expands to 5GHz for traffic offloading
14. heterogeneous devices have diff protocols/priority setting -> no cooperation -> no fair coexistence
15. coex can be done in time/freq/space/code domains -> to implement, need flexibility in at least one domains
16. schemes: centralized coordinator -> distribute resources for all devices; decentralized coord -> each operator does its own optimization indep,
share spectrum through observations & own performance


DCS
1. action set: available channels
2. reward: constant value if successful/unsuccessful data packet transmission

Wideband Autonomous Cognitive Radio (WACR)
1. identify sweeping jammer & others
2. select subband; jammer as radar signals
3. reward func: the amount of time it takes for the jammer or interference signals to interfere a WACR once it switched to a subband
4. WACR at band a: jammer/other user switch to band a = take action a -> get reward R(s, a) = time to interfere orig user

MTRL:
1. some papers about MTRL presumed expert knowledge on planning algorithm
2. take indep exploration to get direct info about env and reward; while expert's trajectories show direct info about optimal policy
3. sample world model -> adopt planner -> weigh model's likelihood based on how likely this model's optimal policy gen expert data
4. use model dist to search in policy space
5. world model unknown, but have expert's trajectories for a world model based on his optimal policy gen by planning algorithm
6. need to estimate world model and find optimal policy
7. MTRL: a seq of MDP chosen from random;y/fixed dist -> dist of MDP by hierarchical Bayesian MM
8. MTRL -> multiple value functions
9. if MDPs are indep of each other -> no mutual info -> just optimize each one 1-by-1 from scratch
10. if share some aspects of the model -> opt for 1 helps opt for other quickly
11. assumption: some MDPs share properties -> transfer model between learning MDPs (if indep, do not share)
12. so need to calc the mutual info
13. use hierarchical inf model (unknown num of components) -> each component represents a similar MDP class (samples in a component = 1 MDP)
contributions: use learned model as prior knowledge to explore new env more efficiently; learn num of underlying MDP classes; adapt to case when
a new MDP belongs to a new class
15. MTRL has a dist over all possible MDPs or tasks
16. observation from indep exploration (direct info) + expert trajectories (indirect info)
17. experts know something about world model -> experts have planning algo to devise optimal policy for a given model
18. want to find underlying POMDP model

16. successive MDPs share similar dynamics/reward func/trans prob
17. use previous opt value func as initial value func for next MDPs
18. gen general features map diff MDP together
-> limited framework -> all assume MDPs share a least amount of info between each together
contributions: maintain prob models of MDP hierarchy; can use common structure between RLs; release dependence between Rls, give more freedom to learn

Organizations:
1. multiple agents: our agents are communication systems and radars.
2. each agent has its own observation set and action set, respectively.
3. use past and current observations to predict true state at next time step
4. objective is to find the optimal spectrum policies which minimize inferences and/or maximize throughput
5. reward function: inference strength + throughput + radar resolution + total spectrum utilization
6. state space: occupancy of the channels (learned on the fly)
7. action space: work on a particular channel (also learned on the fly?)
8. the world model is dynamic because all agents are constantly acting in the env without communicating with each other
9. so world model is uncertain, and each agent's observational scope is localized and hence restricted
10. heterogeneous applications have different measures of QoS, just like decentralized multitask MDP
11. condition of convergence? -> reach local optimization
12. need a glbal reward func: total utilization of spectrum; diff app have diff QoS measurements/priorities; not all available channels fits all
possible applications
13. context-aware: cognize the presence of primary user
14. to simplify problem: channel selection for comm/radar users; present or absent for radars (or consider switch channels); decentralized
(multiagents); diff comm users have corresponding priorities (considered in global reward); a global reward for the optimal utilization of the whole
spectrum; comm user also accepts offline; time-domain (discrete & fixed time slot); radar adjusts its central freq & BW
15. for radar, can use SINR as reward func = when centering at f and BW B; I = interfernece from comm users + noise
16. discretize the radar band, and only contiguous band can be used
17. "spectrum coex of heterogeneous system": to find inspirations for how to measure performance of diff comm app as reward func; incorporate radar;
how to include all heterogeneous app to get global reward function
18. use prob model to model the classification error of the system (channel state identification)
19. for whole spectrum: partition spectrum into individual channels; each app has diff priority; total utilization/interference/priority weight
20. for radar: take contiguous channels (higher BW, higher resolution) -> depends on target, so it's a dependent reward func; SINR + resolution
SINR from collide with comm sys
21 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! dependent reward func (probability dist assigned to R); sequential info for reward func
22. uncertainty: world dynamics/observation noise/hidden states(area in world)/other agent's behavior
23. metrics for assessing the spectrum utilization efficiency are needed as the demand for radio spectrum increases
so does the importance of its efficient use, so new metrics capturing the diversity of technologies are essential.
24. 

SBPR
1. all agents share the same objective func (global value func)
